/*

Create a variable with a Boolean value.
Output the value of the variable to the console.
Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console, using the following syntax:
if(myVariable){
//action
} 
Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether the condition is not true, 
and create a message that will be printed to the console in that instance. 
You should have two if statements, one with an ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement instead—experiment!
Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.

let myVariable = false;
console.log(myVariable);

if(myVariable){
    console.log("My Variable is:", myVariable);
}
if(!myVariable){
    console.log("My Variable is: true");
